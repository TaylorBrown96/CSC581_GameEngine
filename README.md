The **Game Engine Construction Project** is designed to provide comprehensive, hands-on experience in the **design, development, integration, and testing** of a functional game engine. In addition to team-based engine development, each student will implement an **individual game** using the shared engine to showcase system functionalities.

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TaylorBrown96/CSC581_GameEngine.git --recursive
cd .\CSC581_GameEngine\
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build --config Release
.\build\Release\GameEngine.exe
```

> [!NOTE]  
> Run this command after you clone the repo and it was not the main branch:  
> `git submodule update --init --recursive`

## Project Scenario & Process
Your team has been tasked with creating a **modular, reusable engine** that supports rapid development for multiple game genres.  
The engine will be built through **five major milestones**, each focusing on specific system features.  

### Milestones
1. **Build the Game Engine Foundations** (Modules 1–3)  
   - Core architecture, gameplay frameworks, and loop structures.  

2. **Integrate Conceptual Models** (Modules 4–6)  
   - Networking models, time management, and multithreading capabilities.  

3. **Implement Runtime Object Models** (Modules 7–9)  
   - Runtime object models using object-centric or property-centric approaches.  

4. **Construct Event Management Systems** (Modules 10–12)  
   - Event handling, synchronization, and system coordination.  

5. **Manage Game Engine Resources** (Modules 13–15)  
   - Resource management, input handling, and scripting support.  

---

## Deliverables & Assessment
Each milestone requires:  
- Team meetings for planning and task assignment.  
- Team-based contributions to engine design, implementation, and testing.  
- Individual development of a **mini-game** showcasing milestone features.  
- A **reflection paper** explaining contributions and decision-making.  

### Each Milestone Submission Includes
**Team Deliverables**:
- Updated engine source code with documentation and CMake build scripts.  
- A working build that compiles on **Ubuntu 24.04 LTS** or **Windows with VS 2022**.  

**Individual Deliverables**:
- A small playable mini-game demonstrating milestone features.  
- A **1–2 page reflection paper** on contributions, rationale, challenges, and future improvements.  
- **Appendix of screenshots** (not included in page count).  

### Grading Criteria (125 Points Total per Milestone)
- **50 pts** – Individual reflection writeup  
- **40 pts** – Functionality and correctness of engine features  
- **35 pts** – Team collaboration and documentation completeness  

> **Note:**   
> - Since we are CSC 581 students we will need to complete all components, including optional ones (graded out of 125 pts).

## Team Ground Rules

### 1. Communication
- Primary platform: **Discord**  
- Major updates posted in **General** channel  
- Notify team if unavailable  

### 2. Meetings
- **Two weekly meetings** (virtual or in-person)  
- Agendas prepared in advance, notes recorded  
- Attendance expected; notify team if absent  

### 3. Work Distribution
- Tasks assigned equitably based on skill and workload  
- Members must meet deadlines  
- Ask for help early if struggling  

### 4. Code & Repository Standards
- Commit all code with **clear messages**  
- Ensure code compiles and runs on required platforms  
- Follow consistent naming, formatting, and documentation standards  

### 5. Accountability
- Contribute to both **engine development** and **individual game**  
- Write reflective papers individually (collaboration on ideas encouraged)  
- Missing deadlines or poor contributions will be addressed directly  

### 6. Collaboration & Respect
- Treat team members with professionalism and respect  
- Discuss differences constructively with problem-solving focus  
- Final decisions made by **consensus**; escalate unresolved issues to instructor  

### 7. Quality Assurance
- Test all code before merging to main branch  
- Review each milestone as a team before submission  
- Include code comments and milestone documentation as part of deliverables  

### 8. Academic Integrity
- Follow **University’s Academic Integrity Policy**  
- No plagiarism or misuse of assets/libraries  
- Properly cite external resources
